Flight of the Stars, my Ludum Dare 28 entry.

In Flight of the Stars you fly the last offensive starship to protect earth, with a rechargable energy wave as your only weapon. Franticly avoid enemies and their projectiles while building up time until your next shot! It takes 10 seconds for the energy wave to charge, do you have the nerves to fly the last starship on the flight of the stars?

 

Flight of the Stars is my Ludum Dare 28 entry. This game was made within 48 hours, and all the art, sound, and programmaing was done/made by myself!
